<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  A Naco is a combination of nachos and a taco served at Bueno Nacho. It's made by taking nacho cheese and tortilla chips, mixing it with the traditional fillings of a taco, placing it all within a tortilla shell, and then lifting up the sides to make a bag-like shape.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Burrito-Size Flour Tortillas</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 lb. Ground Beef</li>
        <li>1 Pkt. Taco Seasoning</li>
        <li>1 Can Nacho Cheese </li>
        <li>Corn Tortilla Chips</li>
        <li>1 Tomato, finely diced</li>
        <li>Green Leaf Lettuce</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pan brown the meat and prepare it according to the taco seasoning packet instructions (seasoning powder + water). When you're cooking the meat make sure to break it up really well with a spatula.</li>
        <li>In 2 medium pots, warm up the refried beans & nacho cheese (1 pot for beans, 1 pot for cheese).</li>
        <li>Dice up the tomato & break several chips into smaller pieces.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350ÂºF.</li>
        <li>Lay a tortilla on a baking tray & lightly brush it with melted butter.</li>
        <li>Place a ramekin in the middle & then gather up the edges of the tortilla around it.</li>
        <li>Tie a bit of baking string around the top section of gathered tortilla to hold it in place, pulling it enough so that the tortilla isn't simply straight up & down but comes in a little bit at the top.</li>
        <li>Brush some butter in the folds of the tortilla & lift the whole thing up to brush butter underneath, on the tray.</li>
        <li>Slide it all into the oven & bake until the edges of the tortilla are golden brown & the tortilla is stiff, about 5-10 mins.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven & untie the string. Carefully open the tortilla gathers just a little bit, enough to remove the ramekin.</li>
    </ol>
